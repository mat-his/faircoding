# Deep dive into a fairer system

## Principle

The fair coding system act as a SaaS plugin. For now, it is only a Github App listening for events coming from users repos. In the future, this system might be integrated into forum pages, wikis, and bug bounties platforms.
The principle is to associate an existing activity or resource to a price and eventually a payment.
