# The Fair Coding Initiative

## Introduction

The Fair Coding Initiative is committed to empowering open-source software (OSS) by ensuring fair recognition and compensation for developers and maintainers. We believe in the transformative power of open source and blockchain technology to drive innovation and collaboration.
See [faircoding.org](https://faircoding.org) for more information.

## Problem Statement

Despite the critical role OSS plays in technology and society, individual developers and smaller projects often struggle for recognition and funding. Additionally, proprietary solutions frequently leverage open-source code without proper licensing or compensation, posing a threat to the future of open source.

## Our Solution: Blockchain Technology

Blockchain offers a decentralized, secure, and fast way to manage and recognize contributions. By leveraging blockchain, we can:

- Ensure that ownership and contributions are transparently recorded and rewarded.
- Integrate seamlessly with daily tools and applications.
- Provide a secure method for managing intellectual property in the digital space.

## The Cost of Open Source

Open-source software is not costless. It requires time, effort, and resources for:

- Maintaining and updating libraries.
- Writing and updating documentation.
- Resolving issues and providing support.

Collectively, small contributions can have a significant impact on sustaining the open-source ecosystem.

## How to Get Involved

We welcome contributions from everyone. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

1. **Learn More**: Educate yourself about our mission and goals.
2. **Contribute**: Join projects that need your skills and support.
